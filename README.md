# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard built using the Diabetes dataset. The dashboard provides insights into patient health metrics, diabetes risk levels, and BMI/age distributions. It combines calculated columns, DAX measures, and interactive visuals to enable data-driven exploration of diabetes risk factors.

## 🗂️ Dataset Fields

Age – patient age

BMI – body mass index

Glucose – glucose level

Pregnancies – number of pregnancies

Blood Pressure – blood pressure readings

# 📊 Features & Components
## ✔️ Calculated Columns

BMI Category: Classifies BMI into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese

Age Category: Classifies age into Less Than 30, 30-50, High Age

Diabetes Risk Level: Classifies glucose values into Low, Medium, High

## ✔️ DAX Measures

PatientsCount: Total number of diabetic patients

DiabetesRisk%: Percentage of high-risk patients based on glucose >140 and BMI ≥30

## ✔️ Visualizations

Line Graph: Average glucose by age (“Glucose Average Per Age Group”)

Pie Chart: Count of BMI by category

Donut Chart: Diabetes risk vs patient count (High – Pink, Medium – Purple, Low – Blue)

Matrix: Age category, blood pressure, and BMI category (minimal style)

Column Chart: Pregnancies by age category

Gauge: Diabetes Risk %

Cards: Statistical measures (sum, average, count, etc.)

Slicer: Pregnancy ranges

## ✔️ Design & Formatting

Pink background for dashboard consistency

Clear titles, centered where specified

Interactive slicers filter all visuals for exploration

Consistent color palette for readability
